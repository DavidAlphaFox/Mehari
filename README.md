# Mehari

Mehari is a [https://mirageos.org/](Mirage OS) friendly library for building Gemini servers. It fully implements the [https://gemini.circumlunar.space/docs/specification.gmi](Gemini protocol specification) and aims to expose a clean and simple API.

It takes heavy inspiration from [https://github.com/aantron/dream](Dream), a tidy, feature-complete Web framework.
